// IAGO AND OTHELLO
// Othello: did you see someone leaving the room right when we walked in?
//     Iago : No
// OR
// yes, it was Cassio
// Othello: I think it was Cassio! OR
// I knew it was Cassio!
// Othello: Yes! She said it was him! She said he was here asking me to forgive him!
// Othello: omg she won't shut up about it
// Iago: when you were wooing Desdemona, did Cassio know about it ?
//     Othello : Yes
// Iago: JUST WONDERING
// Othello: why were you wondering ?
//     Iago : I didn't realize he knew her
// Othello: Oh, yes, he carried messages back and forth from us very often
// Iago: REaly ?
//     Othello : Really, what ? Do you see something wrong with that ? Isn't he an honest man?
// Iago: Honest, my lord ?
//     Othello : Honest, yes, honest
// Iago: As far as I know, sir
// Othello: What are you thinking ?
//     Iago : Thinking, my lord ?
//         Othello : Thinking, my lord ? You keep repeating yourself! It's like you're thinking something too horrible to say out loud!
// Othello: If you're my friend, tell me what you're thinking.
//     Iago: You know I'm you're friend.
//         Othello: yes, and it worries me, because I know your'e an honest man. And when you withhold things from me, I know it's because you're trying to spare me something terrible.
// Iago: As for Michael Cassio, I'm sure he's an honest man! Sure of it!
// Othello: I think you know more than you're letting on.
// Iago: Please don't make me do that, sir. What if my thoughts are disgusting and wrong?
// Othello: Damn it dude, spit it out.Be a good friend.
//     Iago: I might be completely wrong.I have a tendency to be suspicious and look too closely.You should probably ignore me.
//         Othello: What are you talking about ?
//             Iago : Beware of jealousy! It's a green-eyed monster! The man who knows his wife is cheating on him is happy, because at least he isn't friends with the man she's sleeping with. But think of hte unhappiness of a man who worships his wife, yet doubts her faithfulness. He suspects her, but still loves her.
// Othello: Horrors!
// Othello: If there's any doubt, there's no doubt.If I ever suspected her, I'd look for proof, and if I found it, I'd stop loving her.
//     Iago: In that case, watch how your wife interacts with Micahel Cassio
// Othello: What do you mean ?
//     Iago : She lied to her father to marry you.
//         Othello: That's right, she did.
// Iago: She lied so well her father thought it was witchcraft.
//     Othello: I'm in your debt, Iago. You're a good man.
//         Iago: You seem depressed about this!
// Othello: Not at all!
// Iago: I'm afraid you are. Please don't take this too seriously
// Othello: I won't.
// Iago: Cassio's a good friend of mine.
// Othello: No, no, I'm sure Desdemona would never cheat on me.
// Iago: I hope she never does, and I hope you keep thinking she won't.

// EMILIA AND IAGO
// Emilia: I got you the hankerchief.
//     Iago: Thanks, now leave it at Cassio's house
// OR: handle it yourself

// IAGO AND OTHELLO
// Othello: Aaarrrrrgh, I can't get it out of my head now! It's like a song playing on repeat ?
//     Iago : What is ?
//         Othello : the thought that she's cheating on me.
// Iago: I"m so sorry
// Othello: She could have cheated on me with the whole army and I would have been happy as long as I didn't know about it.
// Othello: My peace of mind is ruined!
// Othello: I feel insane!
// Othello: I'm going to quit this job and move to the country.
// Iago: Please don't.
// Othello: get me proof I can see! Proof, or you'll feel my rage!
// Iago: Oh, god help me! Have you any sense at all.I quit.I'm such an idiot for always telling the truth.
// Othello: No, stop.You should always be honest.
//     Iago: I should always be wise.Honesty's stupid.
// Othello: I swear, I think she's faithful and I think she's not.I htink you're trustworthy one minute and the next I think you're not.I need proof!
// Iago: what kind of proof do you want ? What proof is there ? Would you be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof?
// Othello: One good reason to think she's cheating on me, that's all I need
// Iago: I don't like what your'e asking me to do, but since I've gotten myself in this far and I love you so much, I'll do it.
//     Iago: I heard Cassio talking in his sleep on the voyage from Venice.He was saying Desdemona's name. 
// Othello: Monstrous!
// Iago: It was just a dream.
//     Othello: But it shows something already happened!
// Iago: It's reason for suspicion.
// Othello: I'll tear her to pieces!
// Iago: No, be reasonable.we don't have any proof yet. Tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a hankerchief with a strawberry emrboidered on it?
// Othello: Yes, I gave that to her.It was my first gift ot her.
//     Iago: I saw it today.Cassio was using it to wipe his beard.
//         Othello: I'll kill Cassio!
// Iago: Calm down
// Othello: I want blood!
// Iago: Be patient.You might change your mind.
//     Othello: Never, Iago! I'll get my revenge!
// Iago: Listen, I know you're upset. I'll do whatever you tell me to do.
//     // talk him down OR
//     // encourage his rage
//     Othello: Kill Cassio.
//         Iago: I'll kill him because you want it. But let Desdemona live.
// Othello: No! I need to kill her!

// EMILIA AND IAGO
// Emilia: Desdemona is asking me for her hankerchief.Why do you want it ?
//     Iago : NO reason
// Emilia: She's worried her husband will suspect her if he finds out it's missing
// Iago: oops, I'll give it back
// OR that's ridiculous? Who'd place that much weight on a hankerchief ?
//     Emilia : You'd be surprised
// Emilia: Othello's here and he's furious that she lost it
// Emilia: Jealous bastard

// // Cassio copies the hankerchief
