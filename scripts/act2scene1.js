// Desdemona:
// I'm looking for Othello. Has anyone seen him.
// you notice that Cassio is being extra nice to Desdemona. Useful info. 
// Cassio:
// I don't think his ship is back yet

// Emilia:
// He'll be back soon, Desdemona!

// Insult your wife-- > Desdemona says you're an asshole, asks you to say a nice thing about her
// --> say a compliment(scene ends) OR say you're critical by nature
// OR
// Reassure Desdemona-- > scene ends, Othello arrives

// WITH RODERIGO
// Ugh, you should have seen the happy couple's reunion. Made me want to puke.

// Tell him that Desdemona's completely in love with him OR
// --> tell him to approach Desdemona at the party that night
// Tell him that Desdemona's completely in love with Cassio
// --> tell him to provoke Cassio at the party that night, to ruin his reputation
