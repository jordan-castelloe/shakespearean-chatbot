// A herald announces that Othello plans revelry for the evening in celebration of Cyprusâ€™s safety from the Turks, and also in celebration of his marriage to Desdemona.

// Cassio and Iago
// What's up Iago!! We're on guard duty tonight together!
// Say Othello just wanted to get rid of them early so he could sleep with Desdemona, let's grab a drink!
// --> get him drunk
// cassio IM NOT DRFUNK
// --> nope, you're sure not
// --> proceed to guard duty
// --> you're drunk dude, I'll take your shift tonight
// --> game over
// OR say yes, let's get to guard duty
// --> proceed to guard duty, except Cassio isn't drunk

// if Cassio's not drunk, Roderigo gets in trouble for starting a fight and gets arrested
// Roderigo is no longer active

// Iago and Montano
// Montano: Wow he was so smashed
// Say he's like this a lot and it's a problem
// OR say he's never like this
// Montano: we should say something
// Iago: no, I love Cassio, and I'd like to cure his alcoholism
// Montano: Did you hear something ?
//     Montano : Oh no
// Montano: Cassio's attacked Roderigo!

// Iago and Roderigo
// Go tell everyone there's a riot!

// Othello enters

// Othello: Wtf is going on, Iago ??
//     Iago : Please, everybody stop!
// Othello: How did this start ?
//     Iago : We were all having fun until a minute ago.
//         Othello: Michael, what happened ?
//             Michael : I cant talk
// Othello: Montano ? You're supposed to be calm and collected!
// Montano: I was attacked! Iago can tell you what happened! Michael Cassio attacked me!


// Montano and Iago
// Montano: I know you're close to Cassio, but if you lie to Othello now you're not a true soldier

// Iago: I'd rather cut out my tongue than say anything bad about Michael Cassio! It's just the truth.Cassio was chasing Roderigo with his sword out, trying to kill him.Montano tried to stop him.But nobody's perfect. I'm sure the guy who was running away must have said something awful for Cassio to try to kill him.

//     Othello: Iago, I know you're fond of Cassio and are downplaying this for his benefit. Cassio, I love you but you're fired.

//         Othello: Go and calm down the towns people, Iago.

// IAGO AND CASSIO
// Iago: Are you hurt, Cassio ?
//     Cassio : Yes, but no doctor can help me!
// Iago: I hope that's not true!
// Cassio: I've lost my reputation!
// Iago: Othello's bound to want you back.
// OR Cut your losses and move on
// Cassio: I can't imagine!
// Iago: get in Desdemona's good graces OR
// ask Othello directly
// Cassio: That's good advice
// Iago: I'm helping you because I like and respect you
// OR hell yeah dude, I know how to play people
// Cassio: good night, honest Iago!

// IAGO AND RODERIGO
// Roderigo: I've spent all my money coming here to Cyprus. And I got beaten up. I'm going home!
// Iaog: hold on! Look at that tiny sacrifice! You got Cassio discharged!
// if Roderigo trusts you enough, he stays
// Otherwise, he deactivates
