// //Othello and Emilia
// Othello questions Emilia about Desdemona's loyalty
// Maybe Iago hears it second hand from Emilia
// Othello rages at Desdemona
// Emilia comes in, is worried about Desdemona
// Desdemona wants to talk to Iago(why ?)

// Iago: What's the matter, Desdemona?
// Emilia: He called her a whore so many times, I lost count.
//     Iago: why did he do that ?
//         Desdemona : I don't know. I just know I'm not one.
//             Iago: Don't cry!
// Emilia: She gave up all those chances to marry a noblmean! She gave up her family and friends just to come over here and be called a whore! Wouldn't you cry?
// Iago: Damn him! Where did he get such an idea ??
//     Desdemona : Heaven knows!
// Emilia: I bet it was some evil busybody, somebody meddling, planted that rumor to get some position.I'd bet my life on it.
// Iago: Nobody's that twisted.
// Desdemona: If there is, heaven help him!
// Emilia: If there is, I'll beat him to a pulp!
// It's the same kind of guy who made you think I'd cheated on you with Othello!
// Iago: Shut up
// Desdemona: Iago, what can I do to win my husband back ? I adore him I've never done anything wrong ever, I'M AS INNOCENT AS SNOW MOTHERFUCKER
// Iago: Calm down.It's probably just political business

// IAGO AND RODERIGO

// Roderigo: I’m feeling a little mistreated here.
//     Iago: What makes you say that ?
//         Roderigo : Every day it’s a new trick.It’s like you’re just putting me off.Well, I won’t take it any longer.
//             Iago: will you listen to me ?
//                 Roderigo : I’ve listened too much already.Your words and actions don’t match up.
//                     Iago: That’s not fair.
//                         Roderigo: You’ve spent all my money.The jewels that you took from me to give to Desdemona would have made even a nun want to sleep with me.You told me she got them, and that she’d promised something in return, but nothing like that ever happens.
//                             Iago: All right.Fine.
//                                 Roderigo: I’m just now realizing that I’ve been cheated!
// Iago: Okay.
//     Roderigo: It’s not okay! I’m going to tell Desdemona my feeling.If she returns my jewels, I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her.If not, I challenge you to a duel.
//         Iago: All right, now I see you have guts.I respect you more now.I know why you’re suspicious, but let me tell you that I’ve done everything I can to help you.
//             Roderigo: It doesn’t look that way to me.
//                 Iago: The fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart.But wait just a little longer.If Desdemona isn’t in your bed tomorrow night, then you should find some way to have me offed.
//                     Roderigo: Okay, tell me the plan.
//                         Iago: Venice has made Cassio governor here in Cyprus
// Roderigo: Is that true ? Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
//     Iago: No, they’ll go on a honeymoon.The best way to keep them here is to find something to delay them.We need to get rid of Cassio.
//         Roderigo: What do you mean, get rid of him ?
//             Iago : I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t replace Othello here.
//                 Roderigo: And that’s what you want me to do !
//                     Iago: yes, if you want to help yourself.I’ll help you.
