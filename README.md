## A General Disclaimer About Othello
I'm not a Shakespeare scholar. This would probably piss a respectable Shakespeare scholar off, so let's don't tell them. Othello is well-suited for this format because the central character, Iago, is a sociopath who ruins people's lives by withholding information and lying. He treats it like a game, which makes it great game material. That said, I'm making light of a very heavy and difficult play, and everyone should go read the original and form their own opinions of it.
