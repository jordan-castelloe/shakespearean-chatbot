# Othello Chatbot

This is an adaptation (bastardization?) of Shakespeare's Othello based on the Chatty project that we built for NSS. You play Iago, the central character and villain of the play. 

## Overview
Lines of dialogue read as messages in a chatroom. You can respond to other character's messages by either telling the truth or telling a lie. Your choice affects the characters' responses and the overall story.
 

## A disclaimer Othello
I'm not a Shakespeare scholar. This would probably piss a respectable Shakespeare scholar off, so let's don't tell them. Othello is well-suited for this format because the central character, Iago, is a sociopath who ruins people's lives by withholding information and lying. He treats it like a game, which makes it great game material. That said, I'm making light of a very heavy and difficult play, and everyone should go read the original and form their own opinions of it.
